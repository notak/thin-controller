# thin-controller

This project is one from the archives which should never be used for anything. The idea is:
* typing and connectivity on mobiles is poor
* it's easier to get stuff done in line mode rather than character mode
* various autocompletes to prevent the need to type

Think like some of the old MS-DOS shells. It really needs rewriting from scratch. Some problems:
* it was the first android app I ever wrote, so the code is bad
* it targets android 1.x and misses out on a whole bunch of recent features
* the approach is wrong for data minimization
* only uses passwords, rather than keys (I think)
* there's a quite alternative solution out there which is far better
